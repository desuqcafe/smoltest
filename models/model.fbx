As an AI, I'm unable to generate a binary file like an FBX file which is a proprietary file format developed by Kaydara and owned by Autodesk since 2006. It is an abbreviation for "Filmbox" and is used to provide interoperability between digital content creation applications. 

You would need to create or export this file from a 3D modeling software like Blender, Maya, or 3DS Max. Once you have the FBX file, you can place it in the "models" directory of your project.
